``imcascade`` is a code designed for fitting objects in astronomical images using a "cascade" of Gaussians. It uses multi-guassian expansion (MGE) to model galaxies as a mixture of Gaussians in a Bayesian Framework. It was designed to study the morphology of faint, semi-resolved galaxies. If you are planning on using ``imcascade`` we suggest reading our paper describing the method here (Link to come soon) and the documentation `here <https://imcascade.readthedocs.io>`_.
